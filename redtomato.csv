Red Tomato - Eco Certification,,https://redtomato.org/eco-fruit/what-is-eco/,What is Eco,Core Eco Protocol,"""Red Tomato has developed this protocol to achieve measurable reductions in the use of high-toxicity pesticides. Through our work, we hope to contribute to a bountiful supply of quality, local foods with minimal pesticide residues, and to improve our soil and water resources, wildlife biodiversity, farmworker safety, farm stability and farmland preservation in the Northeastern USA.""",New England,any - certification fee increases with size,"Core Eco Protocol for crops, Eco crop supplement for apples & stone fruit (extra fee)","Operations and Management
1. Are all applicable local, state and national laws, codes and regulations met including those governing all aspects of applications of pesticides, nutrients, amendments,
irrigation and other inputs?
2. Pesticides no longer used or no longer registered for use are returned to dealer or disposed of at the next collection. While in storage, obsolete pesticides are clearly marked and separated from pesticides in current use.
3. Grower has attended one or more educational meetings within the last year.
4. Application records include at least the date and time application started and ended, crop, block(s), acreage, trade name and formulation of material applied (with EPA
registration number, active ingredient, target pest for pesticides and duration of Restricted-Entry Interval), rate per acre, application method, air temperature, wind
speed and direction.
5. Grower belongs to state and/or regional grower organization(s), in addition to participation in Red Tomato programs.","Ecosystem, Soil and Water Conservation
1. Results from soil and/or foliar analyses are used to calculate nutrient application rates, minimize nutrient use and limit potential for nutrient pollution. Timing of any applications is consistent with available Extension or University guidelines.
2. Visibly eroded areas are not present and corrected in a timely manner, if they occur.
3. A vegetated buffer separates surface water from edge of crop by at least 50 feet.
4. Pesticide mixing is at least 120 feet from well heads.
5. Row middles or aisles (drive rows) are sod, mulch covered or cover cropped year round.",,"Pesticide-Risk Reduction
1. Plant and tree canopies are maintained to allow penetration of light, air and spray material using pruning, field renovation or cane removal practices.
2. Pruning debris remaining in the field is flail chopped, mowed or removed, to suppress insect pest and disease inoculum.
3. Pesticide and nutrient application equipment is calibrated at least annually. Records are maintained and include name of person completing calibration, date of calibration, equipment description and procedures, results and adjustments from calibration.
4. Pesticide drift is minimized by monitoring current wind direction and speed with a hand-held monitor, weather station or documented using online resources with real time wind-speed data.","Pest Monitoring and Management
1. Systematic sampling and monitoring are completed for all pests requiring management as per Extension recommendations.
2. If grain-based rodenticides (corn, oats) are used, they are applied in bait stations or burrows only.
3. Weed-free areas in planting rows do not extend into the row middles or aisles.
4. Herbicide mode of action is rotated between each application (during and between seasons).
5. No more than three applications of an herbicide are made per season to the same application site. A fourth spot-treatment may be made if desired control is not achieved and must be supported with documentation which identifies weed species not controlled during previous applications.","Pollinator Protection
1. Existing habitat for pollinators and nesting sites are identified and protected from drift
2. Pesticides with an EPA pollinator toxicity advisory box on the label are not applied between pink and end of crop bloom",,," Food Safety and Product Quality
1. Only fruit of sound internal and external quality are labeled and sold under Red Tomato trademarks.
2. Fruit is harvested at correct maturity according to firmness, brix or other accepted measures.
3. Fruit that has fallen to the ground (drops) are not labeled and sold under Red Tomato trademarks.
4. Clean toilet and hand-washing facilities are available to field, harvest and packing house staff.
5. Manure is not applied to sites where fruit will be harvested within 120 days of harvest.
6. Grazing of livestock or poultry to manage pests and weeds on bearing sites may only be done in compliance with the National Organic Standards. Livestock is not allowed within 90 days of harvest, for crops not touching the ground.
7. Access roads between production sites and packing/storage facilities are inspected for ruts, bumps or rocks and are repaired prior to harvest to minimize fruit damage.
8. Fruit bins and boxes are sound and cleaned as needed to remove soil, plant or animal debris prior to use.
9. Filled harvest containers are not stored outside or left in the field and are immediately transported to packing or storage facilities.
","Energy and Waste Management
1. Open burning complies with local ordinances and is limited to yard waste, wood,
pruning debris and paper-based products. Pesticide containers (including paper),
plastics, rubber or industrial products may not be disposed of by burning.
2. Buildings which are heated or cooled are insulated.
3. Disposal of lead-acid batteries, used oil, industrial chemicals and other hazardous
materials meet state and federal guidelines, i.e., lead-acid batteries are disposed by
taking to approved recycling drop-off locations, e.g., auto-service centers, municipal
recycling facilities, etc."

Demeter Biodynamic,,https://www.biodynamics.com/biodynamic-principles-and-practices,Biodynamic Principles and Practices,"Demeter Association, Inc. Biodynamic Farm Standard","""In day-to-day practice the goal is to create a farm system that is minimally dependent on imported materials, and instead meets its needs from the living dynamics of the farm itself. It is the biodiversity of the farm, organized so that the waste of one part of the farm becomes the energy for another, that results in an increase in the farm's capacity for self-renewal and ultimately makes the farm sustainable. This requires that, as much as possible, a farm be regenerative rather than degenerative.""",national,all,all,,"Soil Fertility Management
Aim is to generate a farm's fertility from within the farming system itself rather than importing inputs from the outside. This generally involves the recycling of raw organic materials generated on the farm with the goal of developing soil humus and the related biological activity that such a process ignites.
